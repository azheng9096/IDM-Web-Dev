          <h1>Ways of <span class="accent bold">Seeing</span></h1>
          <p>
            Modern technology has changed the way we perceive and understand
            art. John Berger discusses the ways in which our ability to capture
            and reproduce art into images through cameras and TV screens has
            potential consequences in the alteration of our perception in a
            piece of art.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Cameras allow art to be captured -- stored and retained forever. They
          can then be reproduced onto the screens of other people's TV and
          easily accessed by thousands and millions of others to see. However,
          photos are also manipulated. The alteration of the image can be done
          in multiple different ways, most notably by movement (e.g., zooming in
          into a certain subject in the art piece) or sound (e.g., adding
          background music).

        <h2>Connection to Modern Media</h2>
        <p>
          John Berger's message from 1972 still rings true today, nearly fifty
          years later. In fact, it stretches beyond classical or physical
          artworks - the message applies to modern mediums as well.

        <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          While it is important to understand the origins and original
          intentions of an artwork, people should not always be condemned for
          their difference in interpretation. Observing an artwork in its
          original environment brings about an understanding of the work in its
          intended message (such as a classical Renaissance work in a
          cathedral), much like viewing and analyzing the characteristics of an
          animal in its natural habitat. However, paintings are not animals. I
          believe the beauty of an art piece lays not simply in the visuals
          itself, but its fluidity -- everyone can connect to an art and
          understand it a different way.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that said, especially in the era of the internet, we also have to
          stay alert in recognizing manipulations of medias around us. The
          "reality" that social media or a news article show us may not
          necessarily be the full picture. Oftentimes, bias will be present as a
          consequence of what the poster chooses to include or exclude.
